For using Open AI gym on nove, you'll need to set up a virtual environment.
To do so, open the terminal and click the following commands:

virtualenv gym

source gym/bin/activate.csh

pip install tensorflow

pip install gym

git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d

cd pybox2d

python setup.py build

python setup.py install

Once you typed these commands you can easily access your virtualenv by typing "source gym/bin/activate.csh"
Pro tip: If you don't want to waste disk space, you can have only one partner to install the virtualenv, and the other will access it by typing "~johndoe/gym/bin/activate.csh"
